# Fil de Fer (Wireframe)

# grades: 105/100

## Description

The "Fil de Fer" project is a 3D wireframe visualization project as part of the curriculum at 42 school. The goal of this project is to create a program in C that can read a file containing point coordinates and display them as a 3D wireframe in a graphical window using isometric projection.

## Objectives

- Read and parse a file containing point coordinates.
- Apply an isometric projection to transform 3D coordinates into a 2D projection.
- Use the MiniLibX graphical library to display the graphical output.
- Handle user interactions to move, zoom, and rotate the model.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local directory:
2. use make to compile the project
3. you can execute the binary "./fdf" with a map as
   parametter ex: "./test_maps/mars.fdf"
   
##fonctionnalities
1. you can use "esc" to close the program
2. use the arrow on the keyboard to moove the map
